ICC CWC Prediction Projec using Deep Learning models

Task 1:\
Some examples of problem statements include:

● Predicting the batsman who will score most runs/ hit most sixes/ make most centuries in
the tournament.\
● Predicting the bowler who will be the leading wicket-taker in the tournament.\
● Predicting the number of sixes/boundaries/5-wicket hauls/hundreds in this tournament for
an individual player or team.

Task 2: Predicting the Finalist Teams and Players
Task 3: Predict the Winner of ICC Cricket World Cup 2023
